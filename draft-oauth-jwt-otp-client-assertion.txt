1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Authentication is a crucial part of modern application.  There are
   various authentication methods for client side applications, and all
   those methods requires user interaction (e.g. login).  This is due to
   the fact that there is no secure way to embed credentials in the
   application code.

   While asking the user to login in order to authenticate the app is a
   strong authentication solution, it has impact on the application
   behavior.  A login is just another step the user has to complete in
   order to use the apps, which users don't always like to fulfill.

   Also, there are cases for applications without any UI, for example -
   Internet of Things applications.  For those applications, adding a
   login steps could be a challenge - see [RFC2142] which discuss
   another solution for console-based applications.

   In this document, we propose an extension to OAuth 2.0 protocol that
   provides a new authentication grant dedicated for those cases.  This
   grant will allow an application to use strong authentication solution
   without user interaction.

   This document defines how a One Time Password, encoded in a JWS, can
   be used to authenticate the client.  The document will discuss the
   entire protocol, including the first registration request.

1.2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  HTTP Parameter Bindings for Transporting Assertions

   The OAuth Assertion Framework [RFC7521] defines generic HTTP
   parameters for transporting assertions (a.k.a. security tokens)
   during interactions with a token endpoint.  This section defines
   specific parameters and treatments of those parameters for use with
   JWS Bearer Tokens.

3.1.  Using OTP JWS for client authentication

   To use a OTP JWS, the client first need to generate the OTP as
   defined in section "JWS format and request processing".  Than, the
   client need to use the following parameter values and encodings.

   The value of the "client_assertion_type" is
   "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:JWS-otp".

   The value of the "client_assertion" parameter contains a single JWS.
   It MUST NOT contain more than one JWS.

   The following example demonstrates client authentication using a JWS
   during the presentation of an authorization code grant in an access
   token request (with extra line breaks for display purposes only):

        POST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
        Host: as.example.com
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        grant_type=token id_token&&
        client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3A
        client-assertion-type%3AJWS-otp&
        client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0.
        eyJpc3Mi[...omitted for brevity...].
        cC4hiUPo[...omitted for brevity...]

4.  JWS format and request processing

4.1.  One Time Password generation

   To generate one time password (OTP), the client use it's state,
   created during the registration request, which is not covered in this
   document.  The state consist from 2 numbers: "previous" and "next",
   64 byte.  In order to generate a new JWS, the client has to roll this
   payload.  The rolling is done by setting the value of "previous" to
   the value of "current", and setting new crypto random value to
   "next".  For example, assuming this is the current state of the app:

   previous: 1
   next: 2

   After rolling, this will be the payload:

   previous: 2
   next: 5

4.2.  Creating the JWS

   After rolling the payload, the client can create the JWS.  This is
   the format of the JWS payload:

   {
       previous: 2
       next: 5
       client-id: 89
   }

   Where "client-id" is the id used when this client first registered.
   To sign the JWS, the client use it's own key, as the one that was
   genereated during the registration of this client.  All the fields
   are required.  Any other fields besides those will be ignored.

4.3.  Request processing

   In order to issue an access token response as described in OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] or to rely on a JWT for client authentication, the
   authorization server MUST validate the JWT according to the criteria
   below.  Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the
   discretion of the authorization server.  When the server will receive
   the request, it will first extract the client-id from the request.
   Then, it will fetch the client information from a storage.  The
   client information contains the payload used by the client on the
   last request, and the key needed to verify the signature of the JWS.
   The server first verify the signature of the JWS using the matching

   key.  If the signature is valid, the server can validate the payload:
   - If the client's "previous" is equals to the server "new", the
   request is valid.  The server will issue a token, as specific in
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] - If the client "previous" equals to the server
   "previous", and the client "next" equals to the server "next", the
   server construct an error response as defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]
   - Any other case will be threated by the server as an indication of
   malicious attack, and should be reported accordenly.  The server
   construct an error response as defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]
